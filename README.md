Predicting house prices in Bangalore, India, based on a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and more. The final prediction model utilizes Random Forest Regression to estimate house prices based on various features and attributes.

## Data Source

`Bangalore Housing Dataset`: This dataset contains information about houses in different neighborhoods of Bangalore. It includes details such as the size of the property, location, number of bedrooms, amenities, and, most importantly, the actual sale prices of the houses.

## Random Forest Regression

Random Forest Regression is utilized to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices accurately. This ensemble learning technique is well-suited for this task due to its ability to handle complex relationships between features.

## Conclusion

The project aims to provide valuable insights into the Bangalore housing market and offer a reliable tool for estimating house prices. By combining EDA and Random Forest Regression, we aim to assist individuals, real estate professionals, and investors in making informed decisions.
